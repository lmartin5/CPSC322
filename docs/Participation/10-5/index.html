    <h1>Javascript Intro</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I am not familiar with Javascript at all. This is the first time I have seen any of it.</li>
        <li>It was interesting that Javascript is a just-in-time interpretted language.
            I am just looking forward to learning Javascript in general so that I can use it for my own projects.</li>
